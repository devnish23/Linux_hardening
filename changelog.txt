In this version, I added checks to eliminate the following
three errors:

1. chmod: cannot access '/boot/grub2/grub.cfg': No such file or directory
   Apparently, grub.cfg doesn't exist if your on an EFI
   system rather than a BIOS system

2. chmod: missing operand after ‘a+t’
   I received this error while the script was checking
   for the sticky bit on world-writable directories.
   I didn't have any world-writable directories.

3. grep: /etc/modprobe.d/ipv6.conf: No such file or directory
   ipv6.conf didn't exist
